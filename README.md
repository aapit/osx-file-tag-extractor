This library extracts OSX metatags from files, and can write them back as part of a text file.
The example (extract.php) pulls metatags (like nvAlt uses) from the files, and writes them back
as part of the note, in the first line, like so: '@tag1 @tag2 @tag3'.

# Usage

```
$ php -e extract.php ~/Documents/notes/
```
